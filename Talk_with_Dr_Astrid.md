We showed a sketch of our software tool to Dr. Astrid and she had the following suggestions :


  * Dr. Astrid described that currently we have 1 hour classes for 1st and 2nd year students, and 1.5 hour class slots for the rest.


  * Dr. Astrid wants us to provide her means to define course slots such that she can fill slots for a subject for the whole week in a single go.

There were some scenarios/features she wanted us to keep in mind :
  1. Course repetition,i.e., keep in mind that some student also repeat courses and it is avoided that popular/core courses overlap with the courses that usually have students who repeat
  1. Some kind of overlap detection for core courses
  1. A feature which allows the admin to set parallel courses or courses which should never run in parallel
