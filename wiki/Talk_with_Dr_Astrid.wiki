#summary We talked to Dr. Astrid about our project on 3rd September.


We showed a sketch of our software tool to Dr. Astrid and she had the following suggestions : 


  *  Dr. Astrid described that currently we have 1 hour classes for 1st and 2nd year students, and 1.5 hour class slots for the rest.


  *  Dr. Astrid wants us to provide her means to define course slots such that she can fill slots for a subject for the whole week in a single go.

There were some scenarios/features she wanted us to keep in mind :
  #  Course repetition,i.e., keep in mind that some student also repeat courses and it is avoided that popular/core courses overlap with the courses that usually have students who repeat
  #  Some kind of overlap detection for core courses
  #  A feature which allows the admin to set parallel courses or courses which should never run in parallel
