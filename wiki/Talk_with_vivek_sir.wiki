#label Initial talk with Vivek sir

= Introduction =
We met with Vivek sir on 11th and 7th of September.The following is a brief of what we discussed.


= Details =

In the initial meeting Vivek sir told us that from this year onwards he isnt involved in the process of making of time table .
He just forwards the time table drafts and the final time table to teachers and students.
In the second meeting he told us about the work that he used to do during time table formation and mentioned a few constraints that they had to take care of while making the time table.
He told us that they receive preferences from various faculty members and try to accommodate as many of them as possible.
He also has to keep in consideration the students who have failed a course, so that they don't miss a core course, and if they have to, only miss at max a single course.
Another thing is that the number of students that actually register for a course may vary from the expected number , so then they may have to reallocate classrooms based on the max number of students that a room can accommodate.
They also have to take care that popular courses dont clash , or if two courses are clashing and enough students want to take those courses then again they have to try and work a way out for it.
