We met Dr.Somitra on Monday, September 10th. Following is a brief of what we discussed.

==The Procedure-An outline==
He receives all the data from Vivek sir, or directly from the faculty. He then tries to formulate the time table according to many constraints and sends it to the faculty for review. Changes , if any, are made to the time table, then room allocation is done and it is sent to Vivek sir for publishing.

==Constraints==
He told us about many constraints he has to consider while scheduling the time table. He receives the preferences from the faculty members as separate emails. He tried to accommodate as many of them as possible, and discards the rest. Moreover, there are some natural constraints on the time table, like not keeping classes of the same subject on consecutive days, so as the students get time to study. Classes are also not kept only on the edges of the week,i.e., Mondays and Fridays, as he tries to keep the option for a long weekend free for faculties ( for attending seminars and not missing lectures). He also has to keep in consideration the students who have failed a course, so that they don't miss a core course, and if they have to, only miss at max a single course. Our institute has also started the policy of 1 hour slots for 1st and 2nd year students, and 1.5 hour slots for the rest. This further complicates the time table system. He also has to keep in mind the slot for faculty meetings, and at that time only tutorials,labs or guest faculty courses can take place, where the permanent faculty aren't needed. Guest faculty is also available on selected days, and that has also to be kept in consideration.

One of the features he suggested was that we could auto-generate the 4th sheet of our time tables,i.e.,the room availability chart , which is doable. He also suggested that we take a look at the IIT Delhi time table mechanism. They follow a slotting mechanism, and he wants us to integrate that, if possible. We are not exactly sure about the slotting mechanism, and will have to have another meeting with him to clarify our doubts.

We couldn't find him the first time around, and when we finally got to meet him, he didn't like our idea much as scheduling the time table is a NP-hard problem and our tool isn't going to make much of a difference in the whole process,i.e, we can't really automate the whole scheduling. If we are able to implement the slotting mechanism, and automate some other tasks, he *may* want to use our product.
