# Details #

In the initial meeting, Vivek sir told us that this year onwards he would not be involved in the process of making of time table .
His job remains to forwards the time table drafts and the final time table to teachers and students.
In the second meeting he told us about the work that he used to do during time table formation and mentioned a few constraints that they had to take care of while making the time table, such as the class room capacity, etc.
He told us that they receive preferences from various faculty members and try to accommodate as many of them as possible.
He also has to keep in consideration the students who have failed a course, so that they don't miss a core course, and if they have to, only miss a single course, at max.
Another thing is that the number of students that actually register for a course may vary from the expected number , so then they may have to reallocate classrooms based on the max number of students that a room can accommodate.
They also have to take care that popular courses dont clash , or if two courses are clashing and enough students want to take those courses then again they have to try and work a way out for it.
