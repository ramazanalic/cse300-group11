**Problem**

The current timetable scheduling system in our college is of a manual nature and requires tedious work by the faculty members to compile, and equally tedious look-ups by the students to schedule out the day. The re-allocation system is also a headache currently, as it requires the concerned instructor to ensure that a mail, informing about the changes in the classroom allocation and timings, is sent out to all the concerned students, which is also a manual task.


**Solution proposed**

This project will define an interactive and user-friendly model of a time-table. It will inculcate features like notifications for dynamic changes ( cancelled/rescheduled lectures) done by the administrator, and vacant room allocation based on the capacity and duration required.

We plan to make the project a real world problem solver, by talking to the concerned authorities and learning about the exact requirement of the industry. We shall then use the constraints they set, as a part of our scheduler constraints.
